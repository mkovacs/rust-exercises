## Principles

Think of these exercises as the equivalent of a workbook for learning a natural language when you already know another.
While a workbook is no substitute for studying grammar and vocabulary, its exercises train you to express yourself in
real-life situations, which is the ultimate goal. Without such exercises, your knowledge of grammar and vocabulary would
be useless.

The goal of these exercises is to teach you how to express your ideas in Rust. As such, they don't intend to do the
following two things.

First, these exercises don't intend to train forming ideas in the first place. In other words, they aren't meant to give
you a basic understanding of computer science and software engineering. If you don't yet have programming experience,
these exercises aren't the right place to start learning.

Second, these exercises don't intend to push your understanding of computer science and software engineering beyond the
basics which you're required to already know. In other words, they consist of problems which you've already seen, the
only difference being that here you need to express their solutions in Rust.

## How to Use

Every exercise contains a `test.sh` script. Your task is to edit `main.rs` to make all the tests pass.
